	                    In 2001, Musk conceptualized "Mars Oasis"; a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing seeds with dehydrated gel, hydrating the gel and having plants grow on Martian soil, "so this would be the furthest that life's ever traveled"[14]
	                    in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase the Budget of NASA.[15][16][17] But Musk realized that even with a much larger space budget, travel to Mars would be prohibitively expensive and that a fundamental
	                    breakthrough in rocket technology was needed.[17] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with <em>Jim Cantrell</em> (an aerospace supplies fixer), and <em>Adeo Ressi</em> (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished ICBMs (Dnepr) that could
	                    send the envisioned payloads into space.[18] The group met with companies such as Lavochkin and ISC Kosmotras. However, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers,
	                    and the group returned to the US empty-handed.[19] In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin, who had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel; NASA's Jet Propulsion
	                    Laboratory; and was just leaving Orbital Sciences Corporation, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. However, this was seen by Musk as too expensive;
	                    Musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[19] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[20]
	                    Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. By applying vertical integration-principally for cost reasons;[18] around 85% of the entire Falcon/Dragon
	                    vehicle is produced in-house[21][22]- and the modular approach from software engineering (Falcon 9 uses 9 of the Merlin engines, which were tested on the single engine Falcon 1, Falcon Heavy uses three Falcon 9 booster stages), SpaceX
	                    could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70 percent gross margin.[23] Another reason for vertical integration is that Musk thinks reusable rockets cannot be built with components from existing suppliers, that all
	                    the other aerospace companies are buying from as well. For example, SpaceX had to design a machine that could friction stir weld aluminium-lithium alloy for the airframe of the Falcon 9, because such a machine did not exist anywhere
	                    in the world.[24] According to Musk, SpaceX started with the smallest useful orbital rocket (Falcon 1 with about half a ton to orbit), instead of building a more complex and riskier launch vehicle, which could have failed and bankrupted
	                    the company.[25]

	                    Number of SpaceX launches per year SpaceX is privately funded.[50] It developed its first launch vehicle-Falcon 1-and three rocket engines-Merlin, Kestrel, and Draco-completely with private capital. SpaceX contracted with the US government for a portion
	                    of the development funding for the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, which uses a modified version of the Merlin rocket engine.[50] SpaceX is developing the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle,[51] the Raptor methane-fueled rocket engine,[52] and a
	                    set of reusable launch vehicle technologies with private capital.[53]
	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    As of May 2012, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion in its first ten years of operation. Of this, private equity provided about $200M, with Musk investing approximately $100M and other investors having put in about $100M (Founders
	                    Fund, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, ...).[54] The remainder has come from progress payments on long-term launch contracts and development contracts. As of April 2012, NASA had put in about $400â€“500M of this amount, with most of that as
	                    progress payments on launch contracts.[55] By May 2012, SpaceX had contracts for 40 launch missions, and each of those contracts provide down payments at contract signing, plus many are paying progress payments as launch vehicle components
	                    are built in advance of mission launch, driven in part by US accounting rules for recognizing long-term revenue.[55]

	                <p>
	                    In August 2012, <em>SpaceX signed a large development contract with NASA to design and develop a crew-carrying space capsule</em> for the "next generation of U.S. human spaceflight capabilities", in order to re-enable the launch of astronauts from U.S. soil by
	                    2017. Two other companies, Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation, received similar development contracts. Advances made by all three companies under Space Act Agreements through NASA's Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap)
	                    initiative are intended to ultimately lead to the availability of commercial human spaceflight services for both government and commercial customers. As part of this agreement, SpaceX was awarded a contract worth up to $440 million
	                    for contract deliverables between 2012 and May 2014.[56][57]

	                </p>
	                <p>
	                    At year-end 2012, SpaceX had over 40 launches on its manifest representing about $4 billion in contract revenue-with many of those contracts already making progress payments to SpaceX-with both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[58] As of
	                    December 2013, SpaceX has a total of 50 future launches under contract, two-thirds of them are for commercial customers.[59][60] In late 2013, space industry media began to comment on the phenomenon that SpaceX prices are undercutting
	                    the major competitors in the commercial commsat launch market-the Ariane 5 and Proton-M[61]-at which time SpaceX had at least 10 further geostationary orbit flights on its books.[60]

	                <p>
	                    In January 2015, <em>SpaceX raised $1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity</em>, in exchange for 8.333% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately $12 billion. Google and Fidelity joined the then current investorship group of Draper
	                    Fisher Jurvetson, Founders Fund, Valor Equity Partners and Capricorn.[62][63] Although the investment was thought to be related to SpaceX's launch of a satellite construction business and global satellite internet service effort,[64]
	                    Gwynne Shotwell said in March 2015 that the investment was not specifically for the global internet project.[65] Google had been searching for a satellite internet partner since the split with O3b Networks and OneWeb.[66]

	                    Conceptual render of Falcon Heavy at Pad 39A, Cape Canaveral Musk has stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space, ultimately by a factor of ten.[67] The company plans in 2004 called for "development of a heavy
	                    lift product and even a super-heavy, if there is customer demand" with each size increase resulting in a significant decrease in cost per pound to orbit. CEO Elon Musk said: "I believe $500 per pound ($1,100/kg) or less is very achievable."[68]

	                <p>
	                    SpaceX has on occasion developed new engineering development technologies to enable it to pursue its various goals. In 2015, public sources revealed that SpaceX is developing their own computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to improve the simulation
	                    capability of evaluating rocket engine combustion design.[69]

	                    In June 2015 the company asked the federal government for permission to begin testing for a project that aims to build a constellation of 4000 satellites capable of beaming the Internet to the entire globe, including remote regions which currently do
	                    not have internet access.[70][71]

	                        He stated in a 2011 interview that he hopes to send humans to Mars' surface within 10â€“20 years.[72] In June 2013, Musk used the descriptor Mars Colonial Transporter to refer to the privately funded development project to design and build a spaceflight
	                        system of rocket engines, launch vehicles and space capsules to transport humans to Mars and return to Earth.[39] In March 2014, COO Gwynne Shotwell said that once the Falcon Heavy and Dragon v2 crew version are flying, the focus
	                        for the company engineering team will be on developing the technology to support the transport infrastructure necessary for Mars missions.[73]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        Musk's long term vision for the company is the development of technology and resources suitable for human colonization on Mars. He has expressed his interest in someday traveling to the planet, stating "I'd like to die on Mars, just not on impact."[74]
	                        To achieve it, Musk plans to establish cargo flights to Mars, getting the first delivery there by 2018. A rocket every two years or so after that could provide a base for the people arriving in 2025 after a launch in 2024.[75][76]
	                        According to Steve Jurvetson, Musk believes that by 2035 at the latest, there will be thousands of rockets flying a million people to Mars, in order to enable a self-sustaining human colony.[77]

	                        Main articles: SpaceX reusable launch system development program and Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        Just Read the Instructions in position prior to Falcon 9 Flight 17 carrying CRS-6 SpaceX has been improving the autonomous landing and recovery of the first stage of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, with increasing success. As a result of Elon Musk's goal
	                        of crafting more cost-effective launch vehicles, SpaceX conceived a method to reuse the first stage of their primary rocket, the Falcon 9,[78] by attempting propulsive vertical landings on solid surfaces. Once the company determined
	                        that soft landings were feasible by touching down over the Atlantic and Pacific ocean, they began landing attempts on a solid platform. SpaceX leased and modified several barges to sit out at sea as a target for the returning first
	                        stage, converting them to autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS).

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        On January 10, 2015 CRS-5, or Commercial Resupply Service 5, launched with the rocket stage set to be the first to land on a solid surface and be recovered intact.[78] The craft made it to the ASDS, though it came in too fast and at an angle, exploding
	                        on the surface of the ship and scattering debris on its surface and in the ocean. The drone ship experienced some structural damages, but nothing irreparable. The cause of the failed landing was determined a failure of the grid
	                        fins used on the craft during the descent to stabilize it, which ran out of hydraulic fluid and ceased to function properly.[79]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        On their next attempt, during the CRS-6 mission, SpaceX was once again able to hit their target, however two issues occurred during the landing. The first was that the craft came in with a higher than expected lateral velocity, though the craft still
	                        made contact with the ASDS. Since the spacecraft was drifting sideways, the bipropellant for the rocket's attitude control should have kept it from tipping, however a valve became stuck and kept the craft from reacting to the issue
	                        quickly. The rocket once again tipped over and was mostly destroyed. In both cases, debris was recovered and examined by SpaceX. Though both landings of the rocket stages resulted in failures, the primary mission was successful-
	                        the Dragon capsules for each mission made it to the International Space Station safely and later splashed down in the Pacific ocean.[80]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        On the next attempt, December 21, 2015, SpaceX successfully landed the first stage for the first time for an orbital launch, landing the first stage booster from their second mission for Orbcomm at Landing Zone 1 at Kennedy Space Center (a Return To Launch
	                        Site landing).[81]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        In January 2016 another ASDS landing attempt was made during the launch of the Jason-3 satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The stage successfully touched down on the drone ship, landing 1.3 meters from the center of the painted target[82]
	                        at a suitable speed. However, a landing leg collet failed to lock, and the stage again tipped over and was destroyed. The leg collet failure was attributed to frozen condensation from fog at Vandenberg prior to launch.[83]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        On April 8, 2016, the first stage booster successfully landed on the ASDS Of Course I Still Love You,[84][85] marking the first time SpaceX successfully landed and recovered an orbitally launched rocket at sea.[85]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        On May 6, 2016, SpaceX landed the first stage of the Falcon 9 on Of Course I Still Love You during the JCSat-14 mission, its second time successfully landing on a drone ship at sea.[86] This was the first time a booster on a geostationary transfer mission
	                        landed successfully. This feat was repeated on May 27 during the Thaicom-8 mission.[87]

	                        On June 28, 2015, CRS-7 launched a Falcon 9 topped with an unmanned Dragon capsule destined to bring supplies to the International Space Station. All statistics were nominal until 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight when a cloud of vapor formed outside
	                        the craft, seen by the tracking camera. A few seconds after this cloud formed, there was a loss of helium tank pressure, after which the tanks exploded and caused a complete failure of the mission.[88] The software was not programmed
	                        to deploy the parachute for the Dragon capsule after a launch mishap, therefore the Dragon broke up on impact.[89]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        The problem was discovered to be a failed strut on the helium pressure vessels that broke due to the force of acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed helium to escape causing the demise of the spacecraft.

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        SpaceX plans to move past the issue while also learning from it by inspecting each of the struts, like that which failed, to ensure they have been manufactured correctly and will function properly. The software issue was also fixed in addition to an analysis
	                        of the entire program in order to ensure proper abort mechanisms are in place for future rockets and their payload.[90]

	                    </p>
	                    <p>
	                        SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell stated that in terms of the differences between the six previous successful Falcon 9 Commercial Resupply Launches, â€œthere's nothing that stands out as being different for any particular flight.  Though the craft was set
	                        to bring a resupply of food and water to the ISS, the crew members had enough supplies to last another 4 months before another resupply, which would end up being the Russian Progress 60P vehicle.[91] Student science experiments
	                        as well as a docking adapter and other miscellaneous cargo was lost due to CRS-7 failure as well.[92]

	                    <p>
	                        On March 1, 2013, a Dragon spacecraft in orbit developed issues with its thrusters. Due to blocked fuel valves, the craft was unable to properly control itself. SpaceX engineers were able to remotely clear the blockages. Because of this issue, the craft
	                        arrived at and docked with the International Space Station one day later than expected. Since spacecraft like the Dragon are classified as munitions and considered weapons under arms regulations, SpaceX Mission controllers were
	                        unable to release more information to the public.[93]
